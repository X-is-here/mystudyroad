The documentation for my studying paths

  This is the documentation for my studying paths. I am intended to record my day to day studies in here. I will give at least 2 hour a day to study and spend 30 to 40 minutes to write my understanding and thoughts throughout my study paths. There might be some mistakes and mistooks along the ways. I don't know whether my repo will help the future people who will walk the same path as me. I hope this repo will help your journey. 
  Starting date for my study -> 22/10/2024
