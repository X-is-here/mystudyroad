Today I learned about http and XXE attack. But I will only talk about http since I only learnt a little bit about XXE!

Websites use HTTP to communicate with us. There are two type of device in http- 1. Client and Webserver.
Sometime even though a server is appeared to be a single device it may be distributed across different devices.

Relaying HTTP messages operate at transport, network or physical layer. Before client and server communicate they must establish TCP connection first but this can cause delay since they have to do several round trips. 

There are three version of http; http 1, http 2, http 3. There is a version called http 1.1 which is a standardized version.
The http connection will go
client <-> TCP <-> server
client -> request -> server
server -> send -> client
	Starting from http 1.1 the connection is no longer closed after 3 pharse

HTTP features included:
  Caching, Authentication, Proxy and tunneling, Session.

HTTP request messages will include - method, path, protocol version and HTTP response message will include - protocol version, status code, status message.

There is something called MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) which indicates the nature and format of a document file or assortment of bytes. MIME type are structured as follow:
  type/subtype;parameter=value
In here parameter=value are optional. There are two type of MIME - 1.discrete, which represent a single file or medium and  2.multipart, which represent a document that is comprised of multiple parts and each part may have its own individual MIME type.

There are two type of proxies - 
1. Foward Proxies ( act on behalf of client )
2. Reverse Proxies ( act on behalf of server )
HTTP tunneling refer to transmitting of network data and information through public network by encapsulating the data. HTTP tunneling is using a protocol of higher level to transport a lower level protocol (TCP)
There is a file called PAC (Proxy Auto-Configuration), which is a js function that determines whether web browser requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP) go to destination or proxy. Auto config file saved with .pac filename extension and MMIE is set to application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig.
